# Final-Project1
#This project has pushed me to my limits.  It took me much more time than expected to learn the quatro systems.  The data I chose was not very good.  The primary was good, but the secondary was unusable. There were no useful statistics in it.  I should have seen that when I selected it.  Overall the data visualizations I was able to generate were lack lucter and did not really answer any questions.  The primary data contained much more interesting data visualization.
#Even with compressing the secondary data set into a zip I still could not upload it.
